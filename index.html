      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        My name is Mike Kenney. I'm a Computer Science student at SNHU about to
        finish my last term. This webpage serves as an ePortfolio for one of the
        projects I worked on during my time in this program, and the various
        improvements I've made to the original application.
      </p>

      <h3>Professional Self-Assessment</h3>
      <p>
        The SNHU Computer Science program has mainly served as a refresher
        course for the majority of the material covered therein. With a few
        exceptions, most of the programming languages and concepts were things
        that I have encountered in my professional career in some form or
        another. For example, CS-465: Full Stack Development essentially saw me
        doing the same work I do on a day-to-day basis with the main exception
        being that I use Vue and React in my day job instead of Angular. I've
        held a number of positions that involved some sort of communication with
        end users and stakeholders, and so I'm familiar with the kind of
        language they tend to use in a corporate setting. I'm also aware that
        one of a project manager's most important responsibilities is to act as
        a sort of buffer between stakeholders and the development team and to
        delegate tasks that they deem appropriate to the scope of a given
        project. The same artifact was used for all three enhancements. This is
        because, given the nature of the application, it was simple to identify
        and implement improvements which satisfied all of the criteria and
        outcomes for the CS-499 course. This choice also allowed me to focus on
        a single code base and programming language, further simplifying the
        overall process as I completed each milestone working toward this final
        portfolio.
      </p>

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        I chose a single artifact that I'd worked on over the course of the this
        program and implemented three separate enhancements to it. This artifact
        was an mobile application that I'd developed for the CS-360 class, and
        the main purpose of the app was to serve as a body weight tracking
        journal. Although the general idea was very simple, the improvements I
        applied to it over the course of the last two months greatly increased
        its usefulness.
      </p>

      <h3>Code Review</h3>
      <p>
        Below is a link to my initial code review in which I read through the
        code of the WeightTracker application while running a local instance to
        demonstrate the functionality. I talk about the approach I took in
        designing the application as well as the future improvements I planned
        to implement.

      <h2>Enhancements</h2>
      <section class="enhancements">
        <h3>Software Design and Engineering</h3>
        <p>
          For this milestone, I improved the application by cleaning up the code
          in a few ways: Firstly, I reorganized some of the methods and members
          to be more intuitive (e.g., moving “create” methods above “read” or
          “delete” methods to follow the CRUD model). Additionally, I provided
          more comprehensive comments to my code to explain the logical flow of
          the program in simple terms. Finally, I removed a number of unused
          imports to cut down on clutter.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this artifact, the course outcomes were achieved. I made the
          improvements that I detailed in my original enhancement plan, and
          demonstrated my knowledge of the software development process. These
          improvements reflect software engineering fundamentals for building
          collaborative environments by providing helpful comments inside the
          code to act as guidelines for any future modifications. If another
          party were to review or modify this code, the comments I've provided
          would allow them to understand the program logic and flow more
          quickly, and identify the expected outcomes and return values for each
          method.
        </p>
        <p>
          Possible further updates would include removing console logs and test
          methods to further reduce the number of lines of code. This milestone
          demonstrated to me that even a simple application can sometimes be
          challenging to design and build. It is important to focus on the core
          functionality when developing an app, however, it can be easy to fall
          victim to scope creep even early on in the development process as you
          do incremental testing. It was also helpful to revisit my work after
          stepping away for some time as it allowed me to look at my code from
          the perspective of a third party who would not be as familiar with my
          aims.

        <h3>Algorithms and Data Structures</h3>
        <p>
          For this milestone, I've added interface elements and functionality
          that allows the user to modify existing entries in their journal.
          Before, the only option if a user made a mistake when creating a
          journal entry was to delete it and try again. Additionally, I made
          some moderate improvements to the user interface, as well as updating
          some error messaging to help the user understand any issues that may
          arise when manipulating data.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this artifact, the course outcomes were achieved. I made the
          improvements that I detailed in my original enhancement plan, and
          demonstrated my knowledge of the software development process. These
          improvements demonstrate an ability to use well-established techniques
          and kills for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that
          deliver value to a product. Improving upon the user experience is a
          crucial step in building any application, as even a well designed
          program can be completely hamstrung by a poorly implemented interface.
          A simple and intuitive design that allows users to extract the
          information they need and perform the actions they want with as few
          steps as possible is typically the best approach.
        </p>
        <p>
          Possible future updates would include adding a dialog that asks the
          user to confirm deletion of existing entries or giving them the
          ability to sort entries by date. This milestone demonstrated to me
          that even a simple application can sometimes be challenging to design
          and build. It is important to focus on the core functionality when
          developing an app, however, it can be easy to fall victim to scope
          creep even early on in the development process as you do incremental

        <h3>Databases</h3>
        <p>
          For this milestone, I've connected the app to a Firebase Firestore
          instance in order to improve the database functionality. Before, the
          app was simply storing the data locally on the user's device. This
          allowed for extremely fast fetching and storage, however, it also
          meant that if anything happened to the user's device or that data, it
          would be lost forever. Storing the data on a cloud server requires
          quite a bit more overhead but also keeps it much safer. If the user
          changes devices or logs in from a different mobile phone, for example,
          their data will still be accessible.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this artifact, the course outcomes were achieved. I made the
          improvements that I detailed in my original enhancement plan, and
          demonstrated my knowledge of the software development process. These
          improvements demonstrate an ability to use well-established techniques
          and skills for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that
          deliver value to a product. Improving upon the user experience is a
          crucial step in building any application, as even a well designed
          program can be completely hamstrung by a poorly implemented interface.

        </p>
        <p>
          This task showed me how difficult it can be to add database
          functionality to an existing app. Even though this particular app is
          comparitively very simple, it was still quite a challenge to switch
          from local storage to utilize the Firebase services from Google. It
          did not help much that Google's official documentation seems to be
          outdated. In the future, I will probably look into other solutions,
          although once everything was finally in place and working, I was happy
          with the results.
